# READMEME for Singly-Linked lists project.

First I made a new directory inside my holberton-low_level_programming repository,
named 0x12-singly_linked_lists. 
Next, I made this README, then I'll create each file for each task.

## Tasks

0. Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

1. Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

2. Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

3. Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

4. Write a function that frees a list_t list.
