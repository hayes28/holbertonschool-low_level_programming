## Project Details

- **Weight:** 1
- **Note:** Your score will be updated as you progress.

## Resources

### Read or Watch:

- [Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
- [Space Complexity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, the following concepts:

- What is a search algorithm?
- What is a linear search?
- What is a binary search?
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs?

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code must follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library. Any call to another function like `strdup`, `malloc`, etc., is forbidden
- You don't have to push the example `main.c` files to your repo, as they will not be taken into account. Your code will be tested using different `main.c` files at compilation
- Include all prototypes in your header file named `search_algos.h`
- Include guards must be used in all header files

## More Info

For files containing big O notations, please use the following formats:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n * m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
